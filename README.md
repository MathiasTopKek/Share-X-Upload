# Share-X-Upload
ShareX upload script made for apache web servers

1. Upload the script to your host
2. Use the example config i've made and configure it to your domain name then run it
3. You should now be able to upload files directly to your site via ShareX



P.S. there are tutorials on youtube.com if you can't follow these steps :)
